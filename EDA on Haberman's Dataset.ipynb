A better parameter would have been cause of death as the person who lost their lives within 5 years may have some other reason as a contributing factor. Apart from this category '1' specificalls is confusing as person may or may not be alive so there is an uncertainty about the current status of the patients who belong to category '1'."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
